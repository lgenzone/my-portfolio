# Lauren Genzone's Portfolio

## Description 

I created this portfolio page to showcase my work, abilities, and interests as a future web developer. I'll be adding to my portfolio page as my coding knowledge expands throughout the coding bootcamp course. By the end of the course, my goal is to have designed a website that effectively communicates the essence of my work while also being aesthetically pleasing and user friendly. Future employers will be able to find all of my contact information, a brief bio, and the projects I've worked on in one convenient location.
